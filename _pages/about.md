I am a research scientist at [Saez-Rodriguez group](https://saezlab.org/) (Institute for Computational Biomedicine, Heidelberg University) where I am currently working on biological network inference. I am interested in deciphering how complex biological systems behave under different conditions through mechanistic and computational models that integrate both prior biological knowledge and experimental data. 

Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral researcher in Computational Systems Biology at [INRAE Toxalim](https://sites.google.com/site/fabienjourdan) (Toulouse, France), where I was working on computational models to understand and predict the metabolic deregulation of cancer cells due to mutations in the TP53 gene.
